# üßë‚Äçüíª Deep Learning Age Estimation with [CoAtNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.04803)

This project is part of the **Deep Learning for Practitioners** course at TU Chemnitz.  
The goal is to predict age groups from face images using advanced neural architectures.

## üéØ Task

Classify faces into 4 age groups:

- `<18`
- `18-40`
- `41-60`
- `>60`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Methods

### Model Architecture

- Used **CoAtNet** model with 4 output classes.
- Implemented fine-tuning strategy:
  - Pre-trained on general images.
  - Then fine-tuned on UTKFace dataset.

### Data Preparation

- Used UTKFace dataset with resized and normalized images.
- Stratified splitting to handle class imbalance.
- Applied basic augmentations (resize, horizontal flip).

## ‚úÖ Results

### Evaluation Accuracy

- **Overall Accuracy**: ~52.79%

### Confusion Matrix Analysis

The confusion matrix shows that the model performs well on younger age groups, especially `<18` and `18-40`, with high correct prediction rates.

However, for middle and older age groups (`41-60`, `>60`), there is noticeable confusion. Many individuals in the `41-60` group are misclassified as either `18-40` or `>60`.

This suggests that distinguishing older age-related facial features is more challenging for the model. The model tends to predict younger classes more confidently.

## üó∫Ô∏è Next Steps

- Improve accuracy on older classes by:
  - Adding more samples for `41-60` and `>60`.
  - Using targeted data augmentation (e.g., wrinkle simulation, style transfer).
- Explore self-supervised pre-training with AgeDB dataset.
- Integrate generative and agentic AI strategies for augmenting data and automatic annotation.
